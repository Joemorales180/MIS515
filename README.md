# MIS515 Projects Overview

## Project 1: Walmart Sales Data Analysis
In this project, we delve into Walmart's sales data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve business strategies. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as sales performance, seasonal trends, and regional variations. Techniques such as time series analysis, regression models, and data visualization are employed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sales dynamics.

## Project 2: Walmart Sales Forecasting
Building on the insights from the first project, this project aims to develop predictive models to forecast future sales for Walmart. By using advanced machine learning algorithms the project predicts sales trends and helps in inventory management and planning. The accuracy of these models is evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected for practical implementation.

## Project 3: Chess Classification
This project focuses on classifying chess games based on various features such as player ratings, opening moves, and game outcomes. Using classification algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines, the project aims to predict the outcome of a game or identify patterns in high-level play. The dataset includes historical chess matches, and the models are trained to improve their predictive accuracy over time.

These projects collectively provide a robust learning experience in data analysis, predictive modeling, and classification techniques, equipping students with practical skills applicable in various data science domains.
